# DM BIKESHARE

## Project Overview
After having a great time in NYC your friend Kate realizes one of the main reasons for all the fun was Citi bike. A couple weeks later, your friend kate calls you and says she has a potential seed investor that can make a bike sharing company in Des Moines a reality. She inlists your help as she knows you have data skills that will come in handy becasue she knows that there are certain metrics that she needs to understand to make this business happen. To assist her with the business proposal she needs:  

- Visualizations created using Tableau public to show key metrics of how NYC Citi Bike operates and how that can be adapted to bring a bike sharing comapny to Des Moines. 

## Resources 
- Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
- Software: Tableau Public 2021.3

## Challenge Overview 
Initially Kate just needed to analyze Citi Bike data to understand the key metrics of the business, so she can adapt that into a similar business for DM Bikeshare in Des Moines. Now, to really sell the proposal she needs you to go a step further and create a bike trip analysis to show the specific times during the days of tyhe week that bikes are used the most and from what locations to tell a story. A story of how the business will continually grow because of thee specific metrics that worked for citi bike and will work for Des Moines in due time. 

## Challenge Summary
After completing the additional analysis the story tells that primarily bikes are used by subscribers and used frequently in heavily popluated areas. The data shows that males checkout bikes on average 10 times more than females but on the other hand females use the bikes far longer. Although, Des Moines is not as densely populated as NYC a bike share there could operate with the same success because a city layout lends well to a bike share company. One more visualization that needs to be added is the average trip utilization by age to see if the average age in Des Moines aligns with this proposed business model.
